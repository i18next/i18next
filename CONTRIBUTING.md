## Testing

### Typescript

To run all typescript test run

```bash
npm run test:typescript
```

If you want to run only a specific project

```bash
npm run test:typescript -- --project many-keys
```

#### New Test scenario

If you need to create a new typescript test scenario:

1. Create a new folder inside `test/typescript`
2. Create a `tsconfig.json` and a `i18next.d.ts` with the relevant properties inside `CustomOptions`
3. If you need to test multiple tsconfig within the same scenario you can create another `tsconfig.json` but with a semantic name between tsconfig and json.
   E.g.: `tsconfig.nonEsModuleInterop.json` inside `test/typescript/misc`
4. For more information about workspace setup check `vitest.workspace.mts`
